            <p>What is afrofuturism?</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <main class="wrapper">
          <p>At first thought, perhaps, an oxymoron.</p>
          <p>On second thought, a vision of fluffy, puffy afros crowning multi-hued afronauts –
        juxtaposed atop a sterile, ivory vision of technological progression – is born;
        space ships and colonization, galactic empires and trans-planetary corporations.
        Further speculation inevitably conjures up nightmares of oppression at an almost
        unimaginable scale as the vagaries of the human soul are pit against the
        relentless drive of technology. Wondrous conceptions exist: Herbert’s Dune,
        Asimov’s Foundation and Brin’s Uplift War come immediately to mind.
        </p>
          <p>Or perhaps the term gives rise to more contemplative dreamscapes, in which the
future approximates the past in a more organic, holistic understanding of the
human condition.</p>
          <p>Civilizations have coexisted before, in synch with the Earth’s natural rhythms,
each another and the biosphere. Examples abound: Kemet, Sumeria,
Mesoamerica, India. Terraced gardens amidst the rainforested mountain ranges
of the equator. Pre-Saharan expanses of irrigated plain in northern Afrika.
Cultivated forestland and ceremonial mounds in mid-latitudinal America.</p>
          <p>Ancient monuments of cyclopean conception witness the passage of time, the
world across. Only ruins of these civilizations remain, yet they provide a model of
truly integrative theocratic dynasties that ensured the existence of poverty-free,
moral based societies girded by certain knowledge of humanity’s inherent
divinity rather than its original sin.</p>
          <p>There exists, deep within the ebony recesses of the net noir, a diverse
community that skirts the quantum-dusted fringes of the new afrikan
technotronic space, awash in a blaze of neon, shining sites proclaiming
knowledge born, revolution and reinvigorated ancestral memory; space that
serves as enclaves of exploration for three generations of diasporic afrikans as
they interact and explore the issues shaping the melanated perspective.</p>
          <p>You must recognize that consciousness is power; being aware, knowing something, and being able to do something is what consciousness is all about. This grants power. Remember, we act in terms of what we know, what we believe, what we expect, what we value, what skills we have. All of this is part of consciousness. Therefore, when you manipulate these things, you manipulate people’s ability.
          </p>
          <p>So ultimately, your salvation lies in power; not in the goodwill of the other people, not in the love of the other people, not in laws on the books. It ultimately must rest on pure power and the ability to stop other people from doing harmful things to you. Anything else is not adequate</p>
              <p>Civil rights is not the same as liberation, independence, and control of one’s self.
              It’s about life, and surviving, and overthrowing, and being liberated as a people.</p>
              <p>An answer brings no illumination unless the question has matured to a point where it gives rise to this answer which thus becomes its fruit. 
        Therefore learn how to put a question.

              <p>Travelling at the speed of thought: album or song titles are like theories condensed into a single statement to be unpacked later.</p>
              <p>We are unlimited spirits that have been restricted by the man made laws and beliefs (of the illusion). Words are used to shape ideas, identities, concepts, actions, and roles for you to follow.

        The first detachment is from the idea that you are your body. you are a spirit first. Think from your spirit. Use your body to enjoy this dimension. We are born into a controlled storyline that we unfortunately see as the natural way of life. The real self has no label. Create your own story; go deeper within and fulfil your souls mission!</p>
